# Chu's Skyrim Randomizer SKSE (V3.0)
  A New skyrim randomizer based off of my older randomizer (found here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25171)
Hoping to increase stability and speed by building a version of the randomizer which randomizes in C++ (rather than entirely in papyrus)

### Requirements
  #### On build
    SKSE64
    LOCKON SSE (https://github.com/aers/LockonSSE)
  ### End-User
    SKSE64
### How (can) I use this?
  As of now this is very much a WIP. However, you should be able to compile yourself and utilise the commands at your will.
  If you truely desire, A pre-built esp and dll are found here: https://github.com/terrificchu/CHUrandSKSE-ESP
